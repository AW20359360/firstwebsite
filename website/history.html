            <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>

            <h2>The Golden Age</h2>
            <p>
                The late 1970s and early 1980s are commonly known as the golden age of arcade gaming. Around this time legendary titles like "Pac-Man," "Space Invaders," and "Donkey Kong" were all released.

            <h2>1990s</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the 90s arcade games there was another arcade game boom thanks to fighting games such as "Street Figher","Mortal Kombat", and "Tekken" and the introduction of 3D graphics.

            <h2>Modern Arcade games</h2>
            <p>
                The introduction of home consoles has led to the interest in arcade gaming dying down in the west though arcade games continue to thrive in Eastern Asian countries such as Japan and China, where arcades are still widespread.
